# ==================================================
# Spring Boot Backend - Environment Variables
# ==================================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: This project uses a centralized .env file located at the 
# project root directory (../../.env.example).
#
# To set up your environment:
# 1. Copy the root .env.example to .env in the project root
# 2. Update values as needed
# 3. All backends and services will use the same configuration
#
# This approach ensures consistency across all services and avoids
# duplicate or conflicting configurations.
# ==================================================

# The following variables from the root .env are used by Spring Boot:
# - DATABASE_URL
# - DATABASE_USERNAME  
# - DATABASE_PASSWORD
# - SPRING_PORT
# - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
